# Snake Game in Odin

This is a simple snake game made by following a Karl Zylinski [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfiQNCNUifI)

## Improvements

~~Make snake wrap around instead of crash into wall [medium]~~
~~Add highscore counter: A separate score counter that doesn't reset when you get 'game over' [easy]~~
~~Currently you can crash into yourself by trying to go 'the other way', i.e. if you press left while going right you'll crash. Try to fix this! [easy]~~
~~Make the snake move smoothly: You can still be on grid but move each part smoothly to the next cell. Might be tricky to make 'feel good'. [hard]~~
~~Add controller support: see rl.IsGamepadButtonPressed [easy]~~
~~Add music: see rl.PlayMusicStream and rl.UpdateMusicStream [medium]~~
~~Add screen shake when you crash and eat food: you can use target on rl.Camera2D. You'll probably need a timer to track for how long the shake should happen [medium]~~
